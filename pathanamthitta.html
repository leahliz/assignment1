  <h2>Gavi-Trekking Trails and Treehouses</h2>
  <p>
    When you are a nature and wildlife lover, you feel at home in places that boast of ecotourism. One such exotic place to visit in Kerala is Gavi, a leading ecotourism spot in India. The forest houses mammals, birds, butterflies, reptiles and exotic trees. Trek down the path with a guide or take a jungle safari – either way, you are bound to be awed by nature’s best every moment.
    You can also take a boat ride in the Gavi lake or one to the fragrant cardamom plantations. One of the interesting places to visit in Gavi Kerala is the Sabarimala viewpoint where you can witness the scenic view of the pilgrimage spot, by taking a short trek. A stay in a tree house is one of the most amazing experiences in Gavi – you can also spot rare birds from your accommodation.

  <h2>Sabarimala</h2>
  <p>
    One of the largest annual pilgrimage spots in the world dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, Sabarimala is the best religious place to visit in Kerala. Join four crore devotees that visit this holy temple every year, to witness pure spirituality and devoutness. Located on top of the hill surrounded by 18 hills and lush forests that form a part of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, a trip to Sabarimala is a must in the lifetime of every believer.
    For tourists, it is like travelling back in time to 5000 years ago, which is how ancient the temple is believed to be. Seeing devotees take a holy dip in the river Pamba at the base of the pilgrimage site is a beautiful experience. It is a good idea to check before visiting because the temple is open for worship only during the days of Mandalapooja in November and December, Makara Sankranti on January 14 and Maha Vishuva Sankranti on April 14, and the first five days of each Malayalam month. For the faithful and for the curious travellers alike, a trip to Kerala is usually incomplete without visiting Sabarimala. So, make it a part of your travel plan and get engulfed in a sea of spirituality.
